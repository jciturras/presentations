  abstract = {This thesis is an investigation of the Perceptions of Meritocracy Inventory (PMI), which I developed to tap into perceptions that people: (1) are rewarded for personal effort and ability, (2) have control over their successes and failures, (3) have equal opportunity to succeed, (4) can achieve social mobility, and (5) are rewarded independently of their social group membership. I found the PMI to be an internally consistent and temporally stable measure of meritocratic perceptions. The PMI positively correlated with other system-justification variables (e.g., just world beliefs and Protestant ethic), negatively correlated with support for social policies that ameliorate disadvantage (e.g., employment and pay equity), and positively correlated with policies that exacerbate disadvantage (welfare reform and cuts to affordable housing). Among participants who completed a tax allocation task, those who scored high on the PMI allotted more dollars to tax rebates and fewer dollars to social programs than did low scorers.},

  volume = {79},
  issn = {0003-1224},
  abstract = {Sociologists want to do more than describe social inequality. We want to understand the deeper problem of how inequality is made and, therefore, could potentially be unmade. What are the mechanisms? How do we uncover them? To do this more effectively, I argue that we need to more thoroughly incor-porate the effects of a relatively neglected form of social inequality\textemdash{}social status\textemdash{} alongside effects based on resources and power. To make my case, I will attempt to show how status acts as an independent force in the making of inequality based on gender, race, and class. Abstract To understand the mechanisms behind social inequality, this address argues that we need to more thoroughly incorporate the effects of status\textemdash{}inequality based on differences in esteem and respect\textemdash{}alongside those based on resources and power. As a micro motive for behavior, status is as significant as money and power. At a macro level, status stabilizes resource and power inequality by transforming it into cultural status beliefs about group differences regarding who is " better " (esteemed and competent). But cultural status beliefs about which groups are " better " constitute group differences as independent dimensions of inequality that generate material advantages due to group membership itself. Acting through micro-level social relations in workplaces, schools, and elsewhere, status beliefs bias evaluations of competence and suitability for authority, bias associational preferences, and evoke resistance to status challenges from low-status group members. These effects accumulate to direct members of higher status groups toward positions of resources and power while holding back lower status group members. Through these processes, status writes group differences such as gender, race, and class-based life style into organizational structures of resources and power, creating durable inequality. Status is thus a central mechanism behind durable patterns of inequality based on social differences.},

  volume = {89},

  abstract = {In a general equilibrium model of a labor economy, the size of government, measured by the share of income redistributed, is de- termined by majority rule. Voters rationally anticipate the disincen- tive effects of taxation on the labor-leisure choices of their fellow citizens and take the effect into account when voting. The share of earned income redistributed depends on the voting rule and on the distribution of productivity in the economy. Under majority rule, the equilibrium tax share balances the budget and pays for the voters' choices. The principal reasons for increased size of government implied by the model are extensions of the franchise that change the position of the decisive voter in the income distribution and changes in relative productivity. An increase in mean income relative to the income of the decisive voter increases the size of government.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates subjective social status using data from surveys collected from representative nationwide samples in  countries (N = ,). We find that in all societies there is a pronounced tendency to see oneself as being in the middle of the social hierarchy; that this tendency holds among those at the top and at the bottom of the educational distribution, as well as among those actually in the middle; and that this tendency holds in rich nations as well as poor ones. The objective position of individuals, the wealth of nations, and the national level of unemployment all have substantial effects on subjective status. But their effects are muted by the tendency to see oneself as being in the middle of the hierarchy. This has important implications for class identity and democracy.},

La presente investigaci{\'o}n propone un marco conceptual y emp{\'i}rico para el estudio de las percepciones y preferencias meritocr{\'a}ticas que, posteriormente, es relacionado con una serie de variables relativas a la desigualdad social. Utilizando datos de la encuesta chilena ``Justicia social y participaci{\'o}n ciudadana'' (N= 1.245), los resultados del an{\'a}lisis sugieren que las preferencias y percepciones de la meritocracia son constructos distintos y que quienes perciben un adecuado funcionamiento de la meritocracia tambi{\'e}n perciben menos desigualdad social.},
